            "content": "Birth of the Python Club website . The goal is to set up a simple website, in the form of a blog, to keep tracks of the various subjects that we discuss at our weekly Python club. . A beginner-friendly solution would be to use the Google Sites graphical-user interface to generate the site and add contents. This is convenient for any static websites where you want to present yourself (CV, lists of projects, …) or your research group / company. . For our Python club, I preferred a slightly more tech-savvy approach based on GitHub Pages and the fastpages project. I was attracted to this solution by the prospect of effortlessly transforming the Jupyter notebooks used for our club presentations into html contents. . From Jupyter notebooks to html contents . What we produce in the Python club are Jupyter notebooks, which are JSON-formatted files. To display the notebooks on this blog, we need to convert these files into html and host the contents to be publicly available on the web. All these daunting tasks are going to be performed freely by: . GitHub pages | Jekyll | fastpages | . The idea, explained in fastpages website, is as follows. . GitHub Pages hosts the contents of our website as a GitHub repository (check our repo) and will send it to any Pythonistas wishing to access our website through their web-browser at https://SylvainDLDK.github.io/PythonClub. . When we add a new notebook to the repository, a workflow designed by the pastpages project is automatically started as a GitHub Action. This will first convert the notebooks into a markdown file (using nbdev), and then run a Jekyll script to transform it in a website. . Finally, and this is optionnal, I decided to buy myself a domain name and use it to refer to the Python Club instead of using the GitHub domain name (github.io). There are many providers of domain names, I used Google Domains to buy sylvaindldk.fr for ~1000 Yen/year. The .jp version was 4 times more expensive! For some reason, the .jp Top-Level Domain (like .fr, .com, .jp) is much more expensive than the .com or .fr. I was perfectly happy with the cheaper French .fr. . After tweeking a few settings, you can now also access the Python Club at https://pythonclub.sylvaindldk.fr. . Adding blog posts in practice . Just add your jupyter .ipynb notebooks into the /_notebooks folder, your word .doc files into the /_word folder, and your markdown .md files in /_posts. Follow the naming and front matter convention described here and there. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
