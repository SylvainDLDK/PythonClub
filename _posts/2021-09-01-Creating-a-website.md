# Website creation

The goal is to set up a simple website, in the form of a blog, to keep tracks of the various subjects that we discuss at our weekly Python club. 

A beginner-friendly solution would be to use the [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new?tgif=d) graphical-user interface to generate the site and add contents. This is convenient for any static websites where you want to present yourself (CV, lists of projects, ...) or your research group / company. 

For our Python club, I preferred a slightly more tech-savvy approach based on GitHub Pages and the fastpages project. I was motivated by the prospect of effortlessly transforming the Jupyter notebooks used for our club presentation into html contents.

## Setting up GitHub

Just sign up... :)

## Using fastai.fastpages

Follow https://github.com/fastai/fastpages

## Adding blog posts

A nice feature of pastpages is that it automatically convert jupyter notebooks (or .doc file) into blog posts (Markdown .md file). Just drop you notebook into the /_notebooks folder. 
You can also directly write the post as a .md file in /_posts.
